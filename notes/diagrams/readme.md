Some diagrams to help illustrate the different write and read behaviours across the different schema candidates.

# Editor notes

## Style notes for consistency

Main desire is to make things easier to view in both dark and light themes.

## Filetype

Saving as editable png (svg introduces a checkering when viewed).

## Filename

Use the '-editable' suffix to help make it clear that these can be opened and edited in draw.io (https://app.diagrams.net/)
Keep it as the suffix so that the filenames are still readable.
